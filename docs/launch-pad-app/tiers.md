# Tier System

The current version of the 9 tier system consists of a system where it is based on guaranteed allocations for all tiers.
For the lowest tiers, most launchpads use a lottery-based system, and even though we want to go with guaranteed allocation for all tiers, with a big base of users, guaranteed allocations for the lowest tier result in a problem that the allocations become too small.

Tier 1 (lottery based Allocation)

Tier 2 (guaranteed Allocation)

Tier 3 (guaranteed Allocation)

Tier 4 (guaranteed Allocation)

Tier 5 (guaranteed Allocation)

Tier 6 (guaranteed Allocation)

Tier 7 (guaranteed Allocation)

Tier 8 (guaranteed Allocation)

Tier 9 (guaranteed Allocation)

Tier 1: 300 PYR, Tier 2: 1100 PYR, Tier 3: 2250 PYR, Tier 4: 6500 PYR, Tier 5: 8250 PYR, Tier 6: 110000 PYR, Tier 7: 22250 PYR, Tier 8: 55000 PYR, Tier 9: 110000 PYR

If you don't have PYR , You can buy it on Exchanges like Binance and Kucoin.
