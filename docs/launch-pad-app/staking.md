# Staking System

Users who are interested in participating in IDOs sand INOs are required to stake a specified amount PYR tokens as part of the whitelisting process.
Once an individual successfully completes the staking process, they are granted whitelisted status. This status provides them with exclusive privileges, such as early access, enhanced rewards, or preferential treatment within the project's ecosystem.

## User Flow

The user has to add a profile and submit a KYC verification request by clicking on the KYC button in his Profile Section. The User will be KYC verified within 24 hours by the administrator.
After KYC verification the user can stake his PYR on the IDO Launchpad platform.
For Whitelisting process the user staked PYR should have been for 24 hours or more in any pool equal to or more than the minimum amount required to fall in any tier. (1-9 tiers minimum amount to fall in the tier can be seen on tiers page )
By default, the user Stake in 7 Day staking pool. If a user stakes more Amount before his staking pool time ends, the user's new staking time starts again from that time.
Users can only stake in One pool at a time. He has to withdraw from the already staked pool and Unstake only can be done after completing the time duration of the staking pool. (If the user has 2 days left in staking time and then stakes more, he will then be at the start time of its staking. This will provide him a disadvantage as whitelist staking time should be more than 24 hours and before 24 hours any IDO goes live, users will not be whitelisted in it.)
If the User Staking pool time ends and he tries to stake more in the same pool he has to first unstake the previous staking amount and then stake more amount.

If the user has staked for 24 hours or more he will be whitelisted in IDO / INO before its start time.
