# INO (Initial NFT Offering)

INOs are similar to ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings), but instead of selling tokens, projects sell NFTs. NFTs are unique digital assets that cannot be replaced by another asset. 
This makes them a valuable way to raise funds for projects, as investors are more likely to be interested in owning a unique asset.
They are a new and innovative way to raise funds for crypto projects and offer investors a unique and valuable asset.
