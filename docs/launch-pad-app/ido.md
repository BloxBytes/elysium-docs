# IDO (Initial Dex Offering)

An Initial Dex Offering (IDO) is a fundraising method used in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry.
It is similar to an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) but takes place on a decentralized exchange (DEX) instead of a centralized exchange.

In an IDO, a project or startup issues and sells its tokens directly to investors through a decentralized exchange. The tokens are typically ERC20 based on a blockchain platform and are often utility tokens that provide access to a project's ecosystem or services.

## User Flow

**Purchase Process:**

Users can purchase IDO tokens using EUSD.
Only whitelisted users have access to the buy button for IDO tokens.

**Allocation Limits:**

Each tier has a minimum and maximum allocation for purchasing IDO tokens.
Users cannot purchase less than the minimum allocation for their tier initially.
Users cannot purchase more than the maximum allocation for their tier.

**Subsequent Purchases:**

Once users have purchased the minimum allocation amount of tokens, they can make subsequent purchases for amounts less than the minimum allocation.
Users cannot purchase more than their remaining allocation from the maximum allocation.

**Display on Profile Page:**

After investing in an IDO, it is displayed on the user's profile page.
If the IDO session is ongoing, it is shown in the In-Progress IDOs section.

**Claiming Process:**

When the IDO session ends, it is moved to the Claims Available section.
Users can claim a number of tokens equal to their investment amount.
The claim process is one-time only.

**Claimed IDOs Section:**

After claiming tokens, the IDO is moved to the Claimed IDOs section on the user's profile.
This section serves as a record of all the IDOs the user has participated in.
