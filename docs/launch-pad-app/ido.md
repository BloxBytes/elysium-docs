# IDO ( Initial Dex Offering )

## User Flow

Users can purchase IDO tokens using EUSD. Only whitelisted users can see the buy button. Every tier has minimum allocation and maximum allocation. The users can not purchase less than the minimum allocation for 1st time and more than the max allocation in their allocated tier. Once they have purchased the minimum allocation amount of tokens then they can buy for a less amount than the minimum allocation but not more than their remaining amount from max allocation. 

Once the users invested in any IDO that ido will be shown on their profile page. If the IDOâ€™s time is not ended it will be shown in the In-Progress IDOs section. When IDO session time ends it is moved into the Claims Available section and the Users can Claim the number of tokens equal to their investment amount. Claim Process is One Time only. After Claiming Tokens the IDO is moved to Claimed IDOs for the users record to show them all the IDOs they have participated in.
