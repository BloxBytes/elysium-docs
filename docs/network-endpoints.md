# Network Endpoints

## Public Endpoints

Ethereum-based networks have two endpoints available for users to connect to: one for HTTPS and one for WSS.

The endpoints in this section are for development purposes only and are not meant to be used in production applications.

If you are looking for an API provider suitable for production use, you can check out the Endpoint Providers section of
this guide.
